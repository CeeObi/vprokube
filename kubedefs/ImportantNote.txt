Please remember to install the ingress controller for aws as this will be usefull for Kubernetes ingress.



Create ingress controller
Steps
Create ec2 instance(kops). it will be talking to the aws services. Thus would need admin access..istall aws-cli..run aws configure->to set up its shell and gain access to aws via the private key created from aws.
-create the ssh key
-install kops to the instance - see install kops link for the os from google search - run "kops" to see output and ensure it is installed.
-install kubectl on the operating system - run "kubectl version --client"  to see output and ensure it is installed.
-create aws storage bucket, dns zone in aws route53, then use link found in the ddc material to create the cluster via kops



Launch the kubernetes cluster
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.1.3/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml
